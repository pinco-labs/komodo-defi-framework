# Mintlayer integration

## Status and review scope

This experimental community integration implements native Mintlayer transfers
and the KDF SwapOps (V1) atomic-swap path. The frozen implementation reviewed
here is `072b38149bbed516c25dbd12c9e60e2330b82ca9`. It is not an official
Mintlayer or KDF release and upstream acceptance is pending.

Transaction building, signing and private keys remain local to KDF. The normal
HTTPS configuration uses public APIs for transaction submission, observation,
confirmation checks and raw transaction recovery. It does not require a local
Mintlayer node RPC. Optional loopback `node_conf` support remains in the code.

## Implemented capabilities

- MINTLAYER protocol registration and legacy `enable` activation.
- Local identity/address derivation, expected genesis validation and balances.
- Spendable UTXOs, coin selection, change, native signing and fee estimation.
- Withdraw construction and optional signed-transaction submission.
- SwapOps maker/taker HTLC payment, spend and refund paths.
- Payment/DEX-fee validation, secret extraction and confirmation checks.
- Chain observation and swap recovery helpers using canonical `tx_hex` bytes.
- Mintlayer orderbook address integration.
- Ordered API reads and capability-aware raw-transaction endpoint selection.
- Bounded read retries for the observed taker-fee indexer visibility race.

## Runtime configuration

An ML coin entry used for trading must not retain the earlier
`"wallet_only": true` setting. Example:

```json
{
  "coin": "ML",
  "name": "Mintlayer",
  "fname": "Mintlayer",
  "mm2": 1,
  "wallet_only": false,
  "network": "mainnet",
  "decimals": 11,
  "required_confirmations": 2,
  "mature_confirmations": 0,
  "requires_notarization": false,
  "avg_blocktime": 120,
  "genesis_block_id": "2cf01f196066bb6f3a4856deb7999294ff520f633fe48e118e8044390e409870",
  "protocol": {"type": "MINTLAYER"},
  "links": {}
}
```

Activation example (API roots, without `/api/v2`; appended by the client):

```json
{
  "userpass": "<KDF_RPC_PASSWORD>",
  "method": "enable",
  "coin": "ML",
  "tx_history": false,
  "required_confirmations": 2,
  "client_conf": {
    "api_urls": [
      "https://mintlayer-api.pinco-labs.com",
      "https://mintlayer-api2.pinco-labs.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

The example adds API2 to the documented endpoint list. It is a proposed
configuration, not a claim that the commissioning swaps already used API2.

## Backend contract

A full backend must support the observation endpoints used by the client,
including genesis/tip, addresses/UTXOs, fee rate, blocks, transaction outputs
and transactions. In addition:

- `GET /api/v2/transaction/:id` must expose `tx_hex` with the canonical encoded
  signed transaction for swap recovery.
- `POST /api/v2/transaction` must accept the signed transaction payload; POST
  routes must be enabled by the API operator.
- KDF validates API transaction IDs, expected blocks and the canonical ID
  derived locally from raw signed bytes where recovery requires them.

The deployed API extension adds `tx_hex` locally to the transaction endpoint
using `hex(serialization::Encode::encode(&tx))`. The server contribution is a
separate review item from KDF; deployment does not imply upstream acceptance.

API1 and API2 are separately hosted/indexed Pinco Labs deployments using the
same API artifact. They provide operational redundancy, not independent
implementation diversity or trustless chain verification. A read-only API
without `tx_hex` is not a complete recovery backend.

## Retry and failover semantics

Reads can try the next endpoint after a capability miss, including a successful
transaction JSON response with no non-empty `tx_hex`.

Submission must be handled separately: ambiguous dispatch outcomes, such as a
transport error, timeout, server error or invalid success body, stop submission
instead of blindly trying another server. Explicitly handled HTTP rejection or
capability statuses have a separate fallback path. These classifications are
part of the requested review.

Taker-fee validation retries the precise all-endpoint `404 Transaction not found`
case and visible-but-unconfirmed transactions for a bounded window. It retries
GET/validation only. Txid mismatches and unrelated/semantic failures remain
errors. The visibility window is 60 seconds with 2-second polling in this layer.

## Golden compatibility reference

Transaction:
`19266863b91c8433e19fd6a6ecac827e2c64b1abd5c3a22cdf667255c8655828`

- Decoded signed transaction: 210 bytes.
- SHA256 of exact ASCII hex (no newline):
  `97e92615f20e0cdb85425e4cb1aa247e1fcb10b1791e1fc86577973ce8920486`
- SHA256 of decoded bytes:
  `5ffd6c18f496e22b31bbeca76b585723564a8a4e41569cd4be05e1dcfaba408a`

These SHA256 values are comparison fingerprints, not the Mintlayer txid.
Both public endpoints matched them on 2026-10-03. Byte parity was also checked
for the ML payments/spends and RC2 fee listed below. This does not itself prove
KDF runtime failover or accepted transaction submission on API2.

## Validation provenance

Project handovers report:

- ML-maker HTTPS-only swap: `5b898e72-b79c-43ca-a200-0150f124ffce`, before RC2.
- ML-taker HTTPS-only RC2 swap: `4abe88c3-7d2a-4f3f-9d42-4799956132dd`.
- Both peers reached Finished/success=true in each run.
- `node_conf` absent and legacy Mintlayer RPC 13030 absent during these runs.
- Final regression: 143 Mintlayer tests, 1 KDF/SDK adapter test, 5 SDK offline
  tests, 1 orderbook test, cargo check coins and mm2_main with utxo-walletconnect.

These are recorded results, not fresh execution claims. The swaps predate API2.
Public GET validation on 2026-10-03 verified both ML payment-to-spend links:

| Role | Payment | Spend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ML maker | `a9ac92cc53d405c8558f41799b9f3d2ed90acf12a84b383946888d12ff4845d5` | `abde36db9d8edb8a395d0dd1a0f24bd674c6ec7259ea765aa2730cf65362a36d` |
| ML taker | `167816a3625219f10dfd85d905fd69aa134cdb7ad1a090c8d058f20c87fe1a9f` | `04d28f371edd279c091dc380a3adf2b368e11f6a9c9a9c21724d578955fae7b4` |

The public endpoints also returned the confirmed RC2 ML fee:
`56c7697fd1cc5b0f84b3665d8a23a74a24ba8890a05bd9b6b571aa07c4f7fd30`.

## KDF API2 live GET validation

On 2026-10-03, the review worktree based on
`072b38149bbed516c25dbd12c9e60e2330b82ca9`, with the new uncommitted
`mm2src/coins/tests/mintlayer_api2_https_live.rs` integration test, returned
**2 passed, 0 failed**, Cargo exit status 0.

- API2-only: expected genesis, golden signed bytes, both SHA256 fingerprints
  and the canonical SDK-derived transaction ID passed through the KDF
  production HTTP transport.
- GET failover: a loopback simulated primary returned HTTP 503; the client
  then retrieved and validated the golden transaction from real HTTPS API2.
  The test confirmed that the simulated primary was contacted.

These opt-in tests perform reads. They establish this specific GET failover
case, not a real API1 outage, a POST submission or a new swap through API2.
`--offline` restricts Cargo dependency resolution; these ignored live tests
still require network access to API2 when explicitly enabled.

Reproduce from the repository root:

```bash
cargo test --locked --offline -j 2 -p coins \
  --test mintlayer_api2_https_live -- \
  --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

Execution provenance (evidence captured at `2026-10-03T10:08:29Z`):

- Rust: `1.97.1 (8bab26f4f 2026-07-14)`.
- Cargo: `1.97.1 (c980f4866 2026-06-30)`.
- Executed test source SHA256, before formatting:

- Preserved test log SHA256:
  `fc25c1f787329f241413ac66ff355faf788d13060ec62544613dc1a662ef2004`.

  `3a0f93bc760ce9704b39fdce76afd5673aa580a5982f5ed3dcfa6e97c5403d5d`.

The successful execution above refers to the preserved pre-format source;
formatting and execution provenance are recorded separately.

## Current limitations

- Scope is the V1 swap path; no Mintlayer-specific V2/TPU or watcher support
  is claimed. Upstream guidance favors V2 for new features, requiring review.
- No transaction-history sync, message signing/verification or address conversion.
- Generic get_raw_transaction/get_tx_hex_by_hash RPCs remain unimplemented;
  internal swap recovery via `tx_hex` is a separate implemented path.
- Withdrawal max, alternate from address, custom fee and memo are unsupported.
- Mintlayer Trezor and WalletConnect key policies are unsupported.
- Multi-platform CI, runtime interruption/recovery and live timed-refund coverage
  are not established by the public byte-parity test.

## Dependencies to review

- mintlayer-sdk: `d462098043d6962a76b405f86cf5ab19a6f104a4`, features `crypto`, `node`.
- Workspace parity-scale-codec patch:
  `5021525697edc0661591ebc71392c48d950a10b0`.
- Cargo.lock additions/replacements and native/WASM feature compatibility.
